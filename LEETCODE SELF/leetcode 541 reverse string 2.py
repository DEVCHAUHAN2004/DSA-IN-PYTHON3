# Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

# If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
# Output: "bacdfeg"
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
# Output: "bacd"
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        s = list(s)       # convert string to list (mutable)

        def reverse(l, r):
            while l < r:
                s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
                l += 1
                r -= 1

        for i in range(0, n, 2 * k):      # do work on every 2k block
            reverse(i, min(i + k - 1, n - 1))  

        return ''.join(s)
